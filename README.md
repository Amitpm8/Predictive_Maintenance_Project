# Predictive Maintenance Project üöÄ

This project demonstrates the power of machine learning in predictive maintenance by utilizing the NASA CMAPSS dataset. It predicts the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of engines using sensor readings, enabling businesses to minimize downtime, optimize maintenance schedules, and reduce operational costs.

## Problem Statement ‚ùì
Industries often face unexpected equipment failures, leading to costly downtime and operational inefficiencies. Traditional reactive maintenance models are inefficient as they fail to predict when failures will occur.

## Objective:
To develop a predictive maintenance system that proactively forecasts engine failures by predicting their Remaining Useful Life (RUL) based on real-time sensor data.

## Key Highlights ‚ú®
### Models Implemented:
- **Random Forest**: Optimized with hyperparameter tuning for accurate predictions.
- **LSTM**: Applied for time-series predictions to capture sequential dependencies.

### Performance Metrics:
- **Random Forest**:
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 29.42
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 41.14
- **LSTM**:
  - RMSE: 43.32

### API Deployment:
- Real-time RUL predictions through a Flask API, making the system ready for deployment in industrial settings.

### Data Insights:
- Identified critical sensors impacting engine life, including Sensor_11, Sensor_4, and Sensor_2.
